== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =

This plugin enables you to use short codes right in the TinyMCE editor when writing a post and/or page. Just type '[collapsible_item title="Your title for this section"]Whatever text you want to display when this section is expanded.[/collapsible_item]'

= What about the pages where I don't use accordions, will my site still load that extra CSS file? I don't want another http request! =

Don't worry son! The style file won't load unless it's needed.
